# Chisme-Group-Project-
  
  CHISME is Spanish for Drama, and thus the gooey gossip collaboration was born of the minds from General Assembly's Software Engineers and UX/UI Desiginers.



# Project Planning and Scope
 
 
  The goal of this project was to replicate the working relationship between developers and designers in order to deliver the minimum viable product.
  For this assignment, our group was assigned two designers from General Assembly's UX/UI course for a total of four developers to two designers.
  The topic given to our group was "celebrity gossip". The project began with the designers building out wire-frames in Figma, while the developers set up github,
  basic project dependencies, and delegated a work flow.

  The challenges our group faced were implementing all of the features that the UX/UI designers wanted while still delivering a polished project. 
  We came to agree that the project needed to have the core utilities and design implemented first, before adding on additional features that would later become
  stretch goals. Overall, it was a pleasure to work with fellow developers and members of the UX/UI team.



# Build Details

  Technologies used: MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, EJS and node.JS (MEN Stack)
  as well as HTML, CSS and Javascript.
  
  Methodology: From a development standpoint, the focus was to try and replicate the look and feel of
  the designers' wire frames before fully building out functionality.
  
  Features: The navbar is fully functional, with an easter egg or two thrown in. A user can sign up, log in, and even navigate away from the page.
  
  Delegation of Work: The developers of our group took turns driving, while being navigated by the other developers in the group. At times there were moments where 
  A developer would ask to branch off. Other times, we would split our group of four into two groups of two for true pair programming.
